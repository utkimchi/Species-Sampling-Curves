# Species-Sampling-Curves
Estimation of species sampling curves within Texan subbasins

>> Collecting events with background data for the Austin-Travis Lakes subbasin

1. Allows for the user to discover periods of time when sampling effort was maximized
2. Pinpoints collecting events when new species were found 
3. Naturally generates an asymptote when nearing the maximum species richness for a subbasin

>> Susbasins shaded by estimated sampling completeness

1. Highlights subbasin most in need of sampling
2. Red indicates subbasins that have the highest probability for new species to be found
3. Blue indicates subbasins are calculated to be nearing or have reached the asymptote for species richness
4. Empty areas indicate the calculation failed for that subbasin due to under-sampling or lack species diversity
